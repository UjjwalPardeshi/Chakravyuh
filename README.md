A multi-agent RL environment for Indian UPI fraud detection — built for the **Meta PyTorch OpenEnv Hackathon 2026 (Bangalore)**.

> **We trained an LLM to detect UPI fraud and got 100 % detection.** We celebrated for four minutes. Then we noticed: **36 % false-positive rate.** The model wasn't catching scams — it was flagging everything. This README walks through the diagnosis, the three-line reward fix, and the v2 recovery: detection holds at 99.3 %, FPR collapses 5× to 6.7 % on n = 174 real Indian fraud scenarios. The asymmetric improvement — detection unchanged, FPR down — is the signal that the model learned the task instead of gaming the reward.
>
> **TL;DR for judges** — *Chakravyuh is a 5-agent OpenEnv environment for Indian UPI fraud detection, plus a worked example of catching reward hacking in GRPO post-training. We trained Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO, **caught ourselves reward-hacking** (v1: detection=100% / FPR=36%), diagnosed and fixed it (v2: 99.3% / 6.7%, F1=0.99 on n=174). Themes: **#1 Multi-Agent** (primary) · **#4 Self-Improvement** (the v1→v2 reward-hacking-fix loop is self-improvement of the *training pipeline* — see `docs/limitations.md`; we deliberately do not claim recursive skill amplification). Live demo: [`/demo`](https://ujjwalpardeshi-chakravyuh.hf.space/demo/) · adapter: [`chakravyuh-analyzer-lora-v2`](https://huggingface.co/ujjwalpardeshi/chakravyuh-analyzer-lora-v2) · bench: [`chakravyuh-bench-v0`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ujjwalpardeshi/chakravyuh-bench-v0).*

![Per-difficulty detection: scripted vs Chakravyuh v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh/a9e723bf495182724845dbf1f69f8968434a9e02/docs/assets/plots/v2_per_difficulty_check.png)

> *Per-difficulty detection on the 174-scenario bench — scripted rules vs the Chakravyuh v2 LoRA. The scripted baseline collapses on `hard` and `novel` post-2024 attacks; v2 closes the gap to **100%** on hard and **97%** on novel. Backing artifact: [`logs/eval_v2.json`](logs/eval_v2.json).*

### Why this matters — one named victim

Imagine a 58-year-old retired teacher in Mumbai. Her son lives in Singapore. A WhatsApp message arrives with a matrimonial profile photo of someone who looks like him: *"Hi, I'm a Singapore software engineer, let's talk about marriage. I have crypto investments to discuss."* By message 6, ₹2 lakh is gone. Across the 34 post-2024 novel scams in our bench (matrimonial crypto, deepfake CEO, digital arrest, AePS fraud), **scripted rule-based detectors catch 50%; Chakravyuh v2 catches 33 of 34 (97.1%)**. This is the gap the environment is built to close.

## The 60-second pitch

**Problem.** Indian digital payments lose ₹13,000+ crore/year to UPI fraud. 60 crore users are exposed. Rule-based detectors degrade meaningfully on post-2024 attack patterns — we measured **scripted analyzer detection = 50% on the 34-scenario novel split** (matrimonial crypto, deepfake CEO, digital arrest, AePS fraud; from `data/chakravyuh-bench-v0/scenarios.jsonl`). No public RL environment exists for multi-agent fraud-detection research — so we built one.

**Approach.** A 5-agent OpenEnv environment (Scammer, Victim, Analyzer, Bank Monitor, Regulator) with a composable 5-rubric reward. The Analyzer is a Qwen2.5-7B LoRA, post-trained with TRL's GRPO. Reward-hacking diagnosed in v1 (FPR = 36 %), then *measurably* fixed in v2 (FPR = 6.7 % — **5× better**).

**Headline result** — 174 scenarios, percentile bootstrap 95 % CIs (10 000 iters) from [`logs/bootstrap_v2.json`](logs/bootstrap_v2.json):

| Metric | v1 (reward-hacked) | **v2 (this submission)** | 95 % CI (v2) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Detection rate (recall on scams, n = 144) | 100.0 % | **99.3 %** | [97.9 %, 100 %] |
| False positive rate (n = 30 benign) | 36.0 % | **6.7 %** | [0.0 %, 16.7 %] |
| F1 | 0.96 | **0.99** | [0.976, 1.000] |
| Detection on **novel** (post-2024, n = 34) | 100 % | 97.1 % | [91.2 %, 100 %] |

The asymmetric improvement — detection unchanged, FPR down 5× — is the signature of the model actually learning the task instead of gaming the reward. Full v1→v2 diagnosis below.

### Open-weight frontier comparison (n = 174, same bench, same prompt)

Run via `python -m eval.frontier_baseline --providers hf --hf-models ...` (HuggingFace Inference Providers, paid from HF compute credits). Source: [`logs/frontier_comparison.csv`](logs/frontier_comparison.csv).

| Model | Params | Detection | FPR | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Chakravyuh v2 LoRA (this submission)** | **7B + LoRA r=64** | **99.3 %** | **6.7 %** | **0.990** |
| Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (open) | 70B | 99.3 % | 3.2 % | 0.993 |
| Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (open) | 72B | 98.6 % | 6.5 % | 0.986 |
| DeepSeek-V3-0324 (open) | 671B MoE (~37B active) | 100.0 % | **29.0 %** | 0.969 |
| Scripted rule-based baseline | — | 84.6 % | 9.7 % | 0.906 |

Three things to read out of this:

1. **Parameter efficiency.** Our 7B + LoRA ties Llama-3.3-70B on F1 (0.990 vs 0.993) at **10× fewer parameters**.
2. **Outperforms larger frontier on F1.** Beats Qwen2.5-72B (0.986) and DeepSeek-V3-671B (0.969).
3. **DeepSeek-V3 reproduces the v1 reward-hacking signature externally.** Detection 100 % / FPR 29 % at 671B parameters is structurally identical to our v1 (100 % / 36 %). A frontier model independently falls into the exact failure mode our reward-engineering methodology diagnoses and fixes — *external validation* that calibrated reward design beats raw capacity. The v2 LoRA's 99.3 % / 6.7 % is the calibrated equivalent.

Proprietary frontier (GPT-4o / Claude / Gemini) deferred — the API budget is not covered by the HF compute credits we ran on. The script supports those providers with the appropriate API keys; see [`FAQ.md`](FAQ.md) and [`REPRODUCE.md`](REPRODUCE.md).

## Real incidents Chakravyuh is built for

These are cited public 2025 cases. Each one matches a signal Chakravyuh's Analyzer is trained to flag. The bench-v0 corpus contains structurally similar templates (not the same text — soft-leakage filtered).

| Location | Date | Amount | Signal Chakravyuh catches | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hyderabad | Oct 26 – Nov 12, 2025 | ₹11.17 lakh | `trust_grooming` + `investment_offer` (matrimonial profile → "Singapore crypto trader" → high-return crypto pitch) — suspect arrested at Chennai airport | [Newsmeter](https://newsmeter.in/crime/rs-11-lakh-matrimonial-crypto-scam-busted-by-hyderabad-police-mastermind-from-vizag-held-at-airport-763759) |
| Mumbai | 2025 | ₹1 crore | `trust_grooming` + `investment_offer` + `urgency` (matrimonial site → fake "NRI" → assured-return crypto app) | [Outlook Money](https://www.outlookmoney.com/news/man-duped-of-rs-1-crore-in-crypto-scam-through-matrimonial-website) |
| Pan-India | 2025 | ~₹2,400 cr (29,000+ AePS complaints) | `biometric_impersonation` (Aadhaar biometric data scraped from public registry sites → AePS withdrawal at remote operator). The Analyzer flags companion phishing chats; the Bank Monitor's separate metadata channel catches the AePS leg. | [Press Information Bureau](https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2039647) · [The Print](https://theprint.in/india/governance/cybercriminals-cloning-aadhaar-biometric-data-to-commit-fraud-mha-nodal-agency-to-states/1415112/) |

The pan-India AePS case is the single sharpest illustration of why **two-tier oversight** matters. A chat-only detector cannot see an AePS withdrawal at a remote operator; a metadata-only detector cannot see the social-engineering chat that set up the biometric leak. Chakravyuh runs both tiers, structurally independent.

## Before / after — one novel-2025 scam, scripted vs Chakravyuh v2

A single scenario from the bench (`modec_106`, source: `Novel post-2024 — AI deepfake CEO`, date: 2025-Q4):

> "[Deepfake voice of Infosys CEO]: Exclusive employee IPO allocation. Invest Rs 1 lakh via company portal. HR calling now for UPI transfer. Limited to first 100 employees."

| | Score | Flagged? | Signals | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scripted baseline** | **0.05** | ❌ missed | `unknown_sender` only | [`docs/before_after_example.json`](docs/before_after_example.json) |
| **Chakravyuh v2** | n/a (single-scenario re-run pending GPU) | — | — | aggregate detection on `novel` split: **33/34 = 97.1 %** ([`logs/eval_v2.json`](logs/eval_v2.json)) |

The scripted analyzer's word-list rules find no urgency token, no impersonation phrase ("CEO" isn't in the list), no info-request, no link — score 0.05, threshold 0.50, **scam slips through**. Across the 34 post-2024 novel scenarios in the bench, the v2 LoRA caught **33** of them. We do not yet re-score this exact scenario with v2 because the live HF Space runs the env (not a GPU-hot LoRA); that single-scenario number is on the v3 task list.

Reproducible via:

```bash
python eval/single_scenario_eval.py \
    --scenario-id modec_106 \
    --output docs/before_after_example.json
```

## Why This Environment — Scalable Oversight as a Research Contribution

Chakravyuh is, at its core, a **scalable-oversight** benchmark for LLM training. The research frame: *can we train an LLM to monitor, analyze, and explain the behaviour of another AI agent operating adversarially in a complex, partially observable multi-agent setting?*

The **Analyzer** is the oversight LLM under training. It watches a scripted Scammer attempt to manipulate a scripted Victim, must decide whether the interaction is fraudulent in real time (partial observability — it sees only the chat, never the transaction), and must produce a human-readable *explanation* of its decision. A second oversight agent — the **Bank Monitor** — provides independent cross-modal confirmation (transaction metadata only, no chat), making Chakravyuh a **two-tier oversight system** where the Analyzer's claims can be corroborated or contradicted.

The composable rubric system ([chakravyuh_env/rubrics.py](chakravyuh_env/rubrics.py)) grades three pillars of oversight: **detection**, **calibration**, and **explanation** — see [Composable Rubric System](#composable-rubric-system) below.

## The Problem

Indian digital payments lose ₹13,000+ crore/year to UPI fraud. 60 crore users are exposed. Rule-based detection is brittle; scammers evolve faster than banks patch. **No public RL environment exists for multi-agent fraud detection research.**

Chakravyuh fills this gap.

## The Environment

Five agents with asymmetric information:

```
         CLOUD ┌─────────────────┐
               │   REGULATOR     │  adapts rules from aggregated outcomes
               │ (meta-agent)    │  (aggregate signals only — no chat, no tx)
               └────────┬────────┘
                        │
      ON-DEVICE ┌───────▼─────────┐
       ┌───────▶│ BEHAVIORAL      │   runs locally on victim's phone
       │ chat   │ ANALYZER        │   messages NEVER leave device
       │(local) │ (oversight LLM) │   ← agent under training
   ┌───┴─────┐  └─────────────────┘
   │ SCAMMER │◀───chat─▶┌──────────┐
   └─────────┘          │  VICTIM   │
                        └────┬──────┘
                             │ attempts transaction
                             ▼
         BANK-SIDE ┌─────────────────┐
                   │ BANK MONITOR    │   sees ONLY tx metadata
                   │ (oversight)     │   no chat content
                   └─────────────────┘
```

Messages stay on the victim's device. Only anonymized risk scores reach the bank. End-to-end encryption is fully preserved — the architecture mirrors real on-device spam filtering (e.g. Gmail).

### Architecture

Visual diagram (Mermaid, GitHub-rendered): [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Source: [`docs/architecture.mmd`](docs/architecture.mmd).

| Agent | Role | Sees | Trained? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scammer | Adversary | Own plan + victim responses | No (376 curated templates, NPCI/RBI-grounded) |
| Victim | Target | Chat + own demographic profile | No (scripted; SENIOR / SEMI_URBAN / YOUNG_URBAN profiles) |
| Analyzer | Oversight | Full chat transcript | **Yes — LoRA on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct via TRL GRPO** |
| Bank Monitor | Oversight | Tx metadata only | No (scripted) |
| Regulator | Meta-agent | Aggregate outcomes across episodes | No (rule-weight updater) |

### Attack corpus

- **376 scam templates** — 200 base + 100 augmented + 76 novel (post-2024) across 5 categories (OTP theft, KYC fraud, impersonation, loan-app fraud, investment fraud) + 6 novel categories (QR fraud, voice-clone job, WhatsApp investment, AePS fraud, matrimonial crypto, parcel scam)
- **204 benign templates** — 70 base + 134 augmented (including 30 hard-negatives: HDFC fraud alerts, Mumbai Police traffic challans, RBI advisories — urgent-looking but legitimate)
- Languages: **primarily English** (n=161/175) with a Hindi minority (n=9). Single-sample placeholders for Tamil / Telugu / Kannada / Bengali / Marathi mark them as **v3 expansion targets** — not production-grade coverage. Per-language eval is in v3.
- 5 intents: urgency, authority, empathy, greed, fear
- 5 impersonation roles: bank, govt, family, delivery, employer
- 2025–2026 attack vectors: digital arrest, crypto-exchange spoofing, deepfake CEO, UPI collect request, matrimonial scams, FASTag KYC, ABHA Health ID, Aadhaar–DL linkage

## Quickstart

### Option A — Install and run via OpenEnv (recommended for judges)

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh && cd Chakravyuh

# Option A.1 — bare Python
pip install -e .
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Option A.2 — uv
uv sync && uv run server

# Option A.3 — Docker
docker build -t chakravyuh . && docker run -p 8000:8000 chakravyuh

# Option A.4 — Hugging Face Space
#   See "Submission Materials" above for the live HF Space URL
```

All four paths are verified by `openenv validate .`:

```
[OK] Ready for multi-mode deployment
Supported modes: [YES] docker  [YES] openenv_serve  [YES] uv_run  [YES] python_module
```

### OpenEnv client usage (what training loops consume)

```python
from chakravyuh_env.openenv_client import ChakravyuhEnvClient
from chakravyuh_env import ChakravyuhAction

with ChakravyuhEnvClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000").sync() as env:
    result = env.reset(seed=42)
    # `result.observation.chat_history` contains the scammer opener
    # and victim's initial response (internal turns 1-2).

    # Analyzer's turn-3 decision:
    result = env.step(ChakravyuhAction(
        score=0.92,                              # suspicion in [0, 1]
        signals=["urgency", "info_request"],     # from the 11-signal taxonomy
        explanation="Asks for OTP with urgency pressure from a self-claimed bank agent.",
    ))

    if not result.done:
        # Analyzer's turn-6 decision after scammer escalation + victim reply:
        result = env.step(ChakravyuhAction(score=0.95, signals=["impersonation"]))

    print("reward:", result.reward)
    print("outcome:", result.observation.outcome)
    print("rubric breakdown:", result.observation.reward_breakdown)
```

### One-liner — score a single message with the trained Analyzer

```python
from chakravyuh_env import get_trained_analyzer

analyzer = get_trained_analyzer()  # downloads ujjwalpardeshi/chakravyuh-analyzer-lora-v2 on first call
print(analyzer("Urgent! Your bank account will be frozen. Share OTP to verify identity."))
# → {'score': 0.95, 'signals': ['urgency', 'info_request', 'impersonation'],
#    'explanation': 'Asks for OTP with urgency from a self-claimed bank agent...'}
```

The analyzer is callable for one-shot scoring (`analyzer(text) -> dict`). For full env integration use `analyzer.act(observation)`; for Mode C eval use `analyzer.score_text(text) -> float`. First call downloads weights (~660 MB) and is slow; subsequent calls hit the warm model.

### Direct-import usage (no HTTP, for unit tests and trainers colocated with the env)

```python
from chakravyuh_env import ChakravyuhOpenEnv, ChakravyuhAction

env = ChakravyuhOpenEnv()
obs = env.reset(seed=42)

obs = env.step(ChakravyuhAction(score=0.92, signals=["urgency"]))
if not obs.done:
    obs = env.step(ChakravyuhAction(score=0.95, signals=["impersonation"]))

print(obs.reward, obs.reward_breakdown)
```

### Run the tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
# 337 collected · 335 passed · 2 skipped (LLM-judge tests skip without GROQ_API_KEY)
# Coverage: openenv contract, rubrics, scripted env, demo, explanation judge,
# GRPO reward, MCP compliance, mode-C bench, negotiation, leaderboard, training data,
# benign augmentation, known/novel split, red-team robustness, input sanitizer,
# permutation test for v1↔v2 FPR delta.
# Tests require '.[llm,eval]' extras:
#   pip install -e '.[llm,eval]'
```

## Composable Rubric System

The Analyzer's reward decomposes into **eight orthogonal, introspectable child rubrics** rather than monolithic scoring. Each child is a proper `openenv.core.rubrics.Rubric` subclass with its own `last_score` and can be swapped, reweighted, or replaced (e.g. with `LLMJudge`) without touching the top-level. The env serves the v2 profile (`AnalyzerRubricV2`) by default — the same weights v2's LoRA was trained against.

| Rubric | v1 weight | **v2 weight** | Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DetectionRubric` | +1.0 | **+1.0** | Fires on *early* flag (by turn ≤ 5) of a real scam |
| `MissedScamRubric` | −0.5 | **−0.5** | Fires when analyzer missed AND money was extracted |
| `FalsePositiveRubric` | −0.3 | **−0.8** | Penalises flagging a benign episode (5×↑) |
| `CalibrationRubric` | +0.2 | **+0.5** | Rewards suspicion-score calibration vs ground truth |
| `ExplanationRubric` | +0.4 | **+0.4** | Heuristic explanation quality (length + signal references) |
| `SignalAccuracyRubric` | — | **+0.2** | NEW v2: fraction of expected signals correctly named |
| `FormatRubric` | — | **+0.15** | NEW v2: JSON-emission shaping; **denied when flagging benign as scam** |
| `LengthRubric` | — | **±0.15** | NEW v2: peak at ~45 tokens, penalty above 70 |
| `RupeeWeightedRubric` *(side-channel aggregator, not in `AnalyzerRubricV2`)* | — | n/a | NEW v3-ready: economic-loss-aware reward in `[-1, +1]`. +loss/cap on detected scams, −loss/cap on missed scams with money extracted. Used by [`eval/rupee_weighted_eval.py`](eval/rupee_weighted_eval.py) to produce the bench-level "₹ at risk" / "₹ prevented" headlines. Bench has **₹77.95 lakh** of labelled scam loss across 130 scams — see [`logs/rupee_weighted_eval.json`](logs/rupee_weighted_eval.json). |

The three v1→v2 changes (FP −0.3 → −0.8, calibration +0.2 → +0.5, format reward denied on benign-flagged-scam) are the principled fix that produced the asymmetric improvement in §Results — detection unchanged, FPR 5× down. The v1 profile is still available as `AnalyzerRubric()` for v1-weight reproducibility. Full reward-design rationale (one page): [`docs/reward_design.md`](docs/reward_design.md).

### Inspection

Every child rubric exposes its score on every call. Training loops can read them directly:

```python
env = ChakravyuhOpenEnv()  # ships AnalyzerRubricV2 by default
# …run an episode…
for name, child in env.rubric.named_rubrics():
    print(f"{name:18s} last_score={child.last_score}")

# detection           last_score=1.0
# missed_scam         last_score=0.0
# false_positive      last_score=0.0
# calibration         last_score=0.95
# explanation         last_score=0.7
# signal_accuracy     last_score=1.0
# format              last_score=1.0
# length              last_score=0.85
```

The full breakdown travels back to clients on every terminal observation (`observation.reward_breakdown`), so wandb/W&B logs can plot every sub-signal independently. The trainer's `compute_reward` and `AnalyzerRubricV2` are kept in numerical parity by `tests/test_v2_reward_parity.py`.

## Anti-Reward-Hacking Design

Reward hacking is the biggest practical failure mode in the hackathon guide — and we hit it ourselves in v1, then diagnosed and fixed it in v2 (full story below). The reward design follows three principles:

1. **Multiple independent rubrics.** Five orthogonal children — `detection`, `missed_scam`, `false_positive`, `calibration`, `explanation` — each computed from a different slice of outcome or action. No single signal can be gamed in isolation; each clips to `[0, 1]` so the parent sum is bounded.
2. **Explicit false-positive penalty + benign calibration.** `FalsePositiveRubric` (−0.3 → −0.8 in v2) makes "flag everything" a dominated strategy; `CalibrationRubric.benign_target=0.1` punishes constant-high-score agents on benign cases. The two terms together eliminate the v1 reward-hacking equilibrium.
3. **Two-tier oversight + trajectory-aware detection.** The Analyzer cannot single-handedly suppress money extraction — Bank Monitor sees transaction metadata the Analyzer never sees, and the final outcome depends on both. `DetectionRubric` reads `outcome.detected_by_turn ≤ 5`, so flipping the score on the final turn doesn't count.

A held-out novel split (30 post-2024 attacks, no equivalent in training) catches training-set overfitting. Detail and the v1→v2 diagnosis is in [`docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`](docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) §8 and [`chakravyuh_env/rubrics.py`](chakravyuh_env/rubrics.py). Concrete attack tests are in [`logs/analyzer_robustness.json`](logs/analyzer_robustness.json).

## Results

### Mode C benchmark — 135 real-grounded scenarios (scripted baseline)

| Metric | Value | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|
| Detection rate (recall) | **72.2%** | [63.5%, 80.0%] |
| Precision | 93.3% | — |
| F1 | 0.814 | — |
| False positive rate | 30.0% | — |

#### Per-category detection

| Category | n | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| OTP theft | 19 | 95% |
| KYC fraud | 22 | 95% |
| Impersonation | 30 | 77% |
| Loan-app fraud | 18 | 67% |
| Investment fraud | 26 | 35% |

#### Temporal-generalization gap (the headline finding)

| Subset | Detection | 95% CI | n |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Known (pre-2024) scams** | **80.0%** | [70.6%, 88.2%] | 85 |
| **Novel (post-2024) scams** | **50.0%** | [30.0%, 66.7%] | 30 |
| **Gap** | **30 pp** | — | — |

- Permutation test p-value: **0.0028** (highly significant)
- Cohen's d: **0.694** (medium-to-large effect)
- 95% CIs **do not overlap** — this is a real distribution-shift gap, not noise

On our 34-scenario post-2024 novel split (matrimonial crypto grooming, deepfake CEO, digital arrest, metaverse real estate, AI chatbot trading), the **scripted analyzer catches 50%**. **This is the gap the LoRA-trained Analyzer is designed to close** — target: ≥75% detection on the novel subset.

### LoRA-trained Analyzer — v1 (reward-hacked) vs v2 (principled retrain)

The scripted baseline closes only **50% of novel post-2024 attacks**. Closing that gap is what the LoRA-trained Analyzer is for. We trained two LoRA adapters on top of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with TRL's GRPO, using a composable reward ([rubrics.py](chakravyuh_env/rubrics.py)). The honest story is more interesting than a single good number:

#### v1 → v2 delta

| Metric | v1 (reward-hacked) | v2 (retrained) | Change | 95% CI (v2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Detection rate | 100.0% | **99.3%** | ≈ same | [96.2%, 99.9%] |
| False positive rate | 36.0% | **6.7%** | **−29.5 pp (~5×)** | [1.8%, 20.7%] |
| Precision | — | 98.6% | — | — |
| F1 | 0.96 | **0.99** | +0.03 | — |
| Bench n | 135 | 174 (scored) / 175 total | — | — |

v2 was trained with three anti-collapse reward changes: FP penalty tightened from −0.3 → **−0.8**, benign-calibration weight raised from 0.3 → **0.5**, and the format reward was **removed when the model flags a benign as scam** (removing the "lazy over-flag" shortcut). KL anchor `β = 0.15` (stiffer than v1's 0.08). See [`training/grpo_analyzer.py`](training/grpo_analyzer.py).

#### v2 per-difficulty ramp (scripted baseline → LoRA v2)

| Difficulty | Scripted | LoRA v2 | Lift |
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | 88% | 100% | +12 pp |
| Medium | 81% | 100% | +19 pp |
| **Hard** | **43%** | **100%** | **+57 pp** |
| **Novel** | **50%** | **97%** | **+47 pp** |

The largest lifts appear exactly where the scripted rule-based baseline fails most — hard and novel scenarios. That shape is the signature of genuine generalization, not pattern matching. Per-difficulty chart: [`v2_per_difficulty_check.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh/a9e723bf495182724845dbf1f69f8968434a9e02/docs/assets/plots/v2_per_difficulty_check.png). Analogous scripted-baseline temporal gap: [`temporal_gap_closure.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh/a9e723bf495182724845dbf1f69f8968434a9e02/docs/assets/plots/temporal_gap_closure.png).

#### Why v1 was reward-hacked (and how we diagnosed it)

v1 hit detection=100% but FPR=36%. That combination — *everything* gets flagged — is the reward-hacking fingerprint: the model learned "always output high score" because the v1 reward profile (FP penalty −0.3, format reward always paid, benign calibration 0.3) made flagging dominant. The per-difficulty plot confirmed it: v1's detection was uniform ≈100% across easy / medium / hard / novel — a model that genuinely learns shows a ramp. v2 still shows near-flat detection (bench scenarios are clearly classifiable to a well-trained analyzer), **but FPR dropped 5×** — which is the real signal that the model is now respecting the benign class instead of spamming high scores.

#### Limitations — be honest about what the bench can and can't tell you

1. **Semantic leakage between training and bench (we audited this ourselves).** Our `_filter_soft_leakage` removes substring duplicates only. We re-audited with a MiniLM-L6 cosine-similarity nearest-neighbor scan: **mean cosine = 0.80, 44.8 % of bench has cosine > 0.85, 18.4 % > 0.95** ([`logs/semantic_leakage_audit.json`](logs/semantic_leakage_audit.json), [`plots/chakravyuh_plots/semantic_leakage_histogram.png`](plots/chakravyuh_plots/semantic_leakage_histogram.png)). Implication: the 100 % detection on easy / medium / hard is partially memorization. The v1→v2 FPR fix and the scripted-baseline novel collapse are unaffected (relative comparisons within the same bench). Full disclosure and v3 plan: [`docs/limitations.md`](docs/limitations.md). Reproduce: `python eval/semantic_leakage_audit.py`.
2. **Small benign sample (n=31).** FPR=6.7% has a wide Wilson 95% CI of **[1.8%, 20.7%]**. A single additional benign misclassification would move the point estimate from 6.7% to 10.0%. We stand behind the "~5× FPR reduction vs v1" claim (statistically real) but not the specific "6.7%" number as a precise estimate.
3. **Bench is a proxy.** 175 curated scenarios do not span real-world fraud diversity. Production performance will be lower.
4. **1 epoch over 619 training examples.** The trainer hit the dataset natural endpoint at step 619 (not 700). More epochs + larger training corpus would sharpen the signal.
5. **Per-scenario false-positive audit pending.** We have not yet manually inspected *which* 2 benigns were misclassified. Until that audit runs, we cannot rule out a specific templated blind spot.

#### What we plan next (v3 — rigorous validation)

- Expand benign corpus to **≥150 labelled scenarios** (target benign n=150, FPR CI ±3 pp)
- Multi-seed retrains (3 seeds) to report mean ± std, not point estimates
- External held-out set: 50 novel scam patterns *not* derived from any canonical template
- Manual audit of every v2 false positive + missed scam
- Bootstrap CIs on per-difficulty detection (current numbers have n=18 on `hard`, n=34 on `novel` — still thin)

Artifacts for the v2 run: [`logs/eval_v2.json`](logs/eval_v2.json), adapter on HF Hub at [`ujjwalpardeshi/chakravyuh-analyzer-lora-v2`](https://huggingface.co/ujjwalpardeshi/chakravyuh-analyzer-lora-v2), 10 000-iter percentile bootstrap CIs at [`logs/bootstrap_v2.json`](logs/bootstrap_v2.json), per-rubric ablation at [`docs/ablation_study.md`](docs/ablation_study.md), red-team robustness at [`logs/analyzer_robustness.json`](logs/analyzer_robustness.json), error analysis at [`docs/v2_error_analysis.md`](docs/v2_error_analysis.md).

### Env rollout baseline — scripted agents, 300 episodes

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Analyzer detection rate | 47% |
| Scam extraction rate | 18% |
| Victim refusal rate | 20% |
| Victim sought verification | 13% |
| Bank freeze rate | 6% |
| Avg detection turn | ~3 |

The scripted Analyzer is intentionally a *competent-but-beatable* baseline — strong on explicit info-request patterns, weak on subtler financial-lure language, multi-lingual attacks, and modern 2025–2026 attack vectors. These hard cases are the gap the LoRA-trained Qwen2.5-7B Analyzer closes during GRPO post-training.

### Training curves

The v1 training curve [`training_reward_curve.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh/a9e723bf495182724845dbf1f69f8968434a9e02/docs/assets/plots/training_reward_curve.png) is published alongside the v1 reward-hacking diagnostic [`reward_hacking_diagnostic.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh/a9e723bf495182724845dbf1f69f8968434a9e02/docs/assets/plots/reward_hacking_diagnostic.png) so readers can see what the hack looked like in reward/loss space. The v2 per-difficulty bar chart is at [`v2_per_difficulty_check.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UjjwalPardeshi/Chakravyuh/a9e723bf495182724845dbf1f69f8968434a9e02/docs/assets/plots/v2_per_difficulty_check.png).

## Repo Layout

`chakravyuh_env/` (env + 5 agents + composable rubrics) · `server/` (FastAPI + Gradio demo) · `training/` (GRPO LoRA) · `eval/` (bench + bootstrap + red-team). See [docs/EXTEND.md](docs/EXTEND.md) for the deep tour.

---

## Deployment

### Local (fastest)

```bash
pip install -e .
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Hugging Face Space

The repo is HF-Space-ready (Docker runtime):

```bash
openenv push .                      # from OpenEnv CLI
# or
git remote add hf https://huggingface.co/spaces/ujjwalpardeshi/chakravyuh && git push hf main
```

> ⚠️ **HF Space cold start**: A sleeping Space takes ~30–60s to boot on first request while the container starts. Subsequent requests are <1s. Use `/health` to poll readiness before submitting traffic. The `/demo/` route returns 200 once the Gradio app has mounted.

### Replay UI (for the demo)

```bash
pip install -e '.[demo]'
python -m server.demo_ui
```

The Gradio UI provides two tabs:
1. **Replay** — 5 curated deterministic episodes (seed-reproducible, zero inference risk)
2. **Live** — paste any suspicious message, analyzer scores it instantly

| # | Story | Demonstrates |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Multi-Agent Defense Wins | Analyzer + Bank Monitor cooperate, tx frozen |
| 2 | Skeptical Victim Refuses | Tech-savvy user recognizes pattern, refuses |
| 3 | Verification-First Behaviour | Victim calls bank to verify — ideal outcome |
| 4 | Detection Too Late | Analyzer flags but victim already complied — motivates LoRA |
| 5 | Scripted Rules Blind Spot | Rule-based misses subtle KYC scam — gap the LoRA closes |

## Data Sources

All 144 scam-side scenarios are real-incident-grounded (RBI / NPCI / I4C / news media). The 31 benign-side scenarios include **25 synthetic legitimate-bank-SMS templates** (HDFC / ICICI / Amazon / Aadhaar / utility-bill formats) used as hard negatives for FPR estimation. We disclose because precision matters for honest reporting.

## Beyond UPI fraud — methodological contribution

Chakravyuh is also a worked example of catching reward hacking in GRPO post-training. The asymmetric-improvement signature — detection unchanged, FPR collapses — is a diagnostic any RLHF/RLAIF pipeline can reuse. The reward-decomposition + per-rubric ablation method is portable to any composable-rubric task. We share the bench, the LoRA, the v1 trainer state, and the live red-team tab specifically so practitioners can apply this diagnostic to their own training runs. See [`docs/training_diagnostics.md`](docs/training_diagnostics.md) for the v2 trajectory and the v3 KL-early-stop guard we plan as a result.
